* How to report an Issue

(Nearly) every MAXS issue report should come with an debug
log. Otherwise it's hard to analyze and solve the problem.

First make sure that the "Debug Log" setting of the relevant MAXS
components are checked. Then you need re-create the issue and shortly
after that gather the log. This can be done either via =adb= from the
Android SDK, which requires the device to have the developer
connection enabled, or via Apps like CatLog, which require root
access.

After you have obtained the log, post the issue at

** Using an CatLog

If you have root, you can use [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nolanlawson.logcat][CatLog]] to export the log.

** Using Android SDK: =adb shell logcat=

This requires the [[http://developer.android.com/tools/help/adb.html][Android Debug Bridge]]: =adb=.

Using the =logcat= binary, available on every Android device, without
any argument will print the current logs and follow them. Usually you
want to only dump the logs, and since having a timestamp is always
nice when it comes to logs, the recommend way of invocation to obtain
useful log information for MAXS is

#+BEGIN_SRC
adb shell logcat -v time -d
#+END_SRC

Since MAXS does prefix every log tag with 'MAXS', you can restrict the
output using grep

#+BEGIN_SRC
adb shell logcat -v time -d |grep -i MAXS |less
#+END_SRC
