This extension needs client support.

MAXS Transport XMPP tries to configure a privacy list that only allows
stanzas from JIDs that have the [[http://xmpp.org/rfcs/rfc6121.html#roster-syntax-items-subscription][subscription attribute]] 'both' and
messages with the subscription attribute 'to'. All other stanzas are
rejected.

This prevents a potential DOS vector, where an attacker sends a
massive amount of stanzas to the device running MAXS. While we believe
that no remote exploit would be possible, it still could negatively
affect battery lifetime and other aspects of the user experience.

Allows XMPP entities to discover information about other entities.

This extension needs server and client support.

* [[http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0033.html][XEP-0033]] Extended Stanza Addressing

If a stanza has to be sent to multiple entities, MAXS Transport XMPP
tries to make use of Extended Stanza Addressing, so that instead of
sending the same stanza multiple times, it is only send once addressed
to multiple XMPP entities.

This extension needs server support.

* [[http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0047.html][XEP-0047]] In-Band Bytestreams

MAXS Transport XMPP uses In-Band Bytestreams as fallback method for
file transfers.

This extension needs client support.

* [[http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0065.html][XEP-0065]] SOCKS5 Bytestreams

MAXS Transport XMPP uses SOCKS5 Bytestreams as primary, NAT resistant,
method for XMPP file transfer.

This extension needs client support. Other XMPP entities, such as
servers, may also support SI File Transfer, for increased reliability.

* [[http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0071.html][XEP-0071]] XHTML-IM

MAXS Transport XMPP will automatically detect if the involved XMPP
entities support XHTML-IM and add the XHTML-IM body to messages if
supported.

This extension needs clients support.

* [[http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0077.html][XEP-0077]] In-Band Registration

MAXS Transport XMPP allows you to conveniently register an XMPP
account from within the application on servers supporting it.

This extension needs server support.

* [[http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0092.html][XEP-0092]] Software Version

MAXS Transport XMPP will report it's version including the git revision and built date when queried by a master JID for it.
Furthermore the returned information will also include the used Android version and API Level and the Smack (the used XMPP library) version, git revision and built date.

* [[http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0095.html][XEP-0095]] Stream Initiation

This extension needs client support.

* [[http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0096.html][XEP-0096]] SI File Transfer

Used for the file transfer feature of Project MAXS. Note that
XEP-0069, XEP-0047 and XEP-0065 based XMPP file transfers are per
default *not encrypted*.

This extension needs client support. Other XMPP entities, such as
servers, may also support SI File Transfer, for increased reliability.

* [[http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0115.html][XEP-0115]] Entity Capabilities

Entity Capabilities provides a mechanism for caching, and hence
eliding, the =disco#info= requests needed to negotiate optional
features. It therefore lowers power consumption when used.

This extension needs clients supporting it. Other XMPP entities, such
as servers, may also use Entity Capabilities.

* [[http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0138.html][XEP-0138]] Stream Compression

MAXS Transport XMPP will try to use stream compression if configured
and available. Experiments show that stream compression will increase
battery lifetime for mobile devices because of the reduced radio
usage. More information can be found in [[http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0286.html][XEP-0286]].

This extension needs server supporting it.

Tip: Get [[http://gajim.org][Gajim]] 0.16 and set [[https://trac.gajim.org/ticket/7341][positive_184_acks]] to true in Gajim's
"Advanced Configuration Editor" to get the most out of XEP-0184 :)

This extension needs clients supporting it.

* [[http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0198.html][XEP-0198]] Stream Management

XMPP Stream Management enables fast resumption of the XMPP Connection in case there is a sudden disconnect (e.g. Wifi â†” GSM switch).
Using MAXS with enabled Stream Mangement on XMPP services that support this feature will improve the connection reliablitiy somewhat.

* [[http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0199.html][XEP-0199]] XMPP Ping

MAXS Transport XMPP sends periodically XMPP pings to the user's server
in order to test the XMPP connection.
