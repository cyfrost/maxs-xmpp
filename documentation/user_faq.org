* MAXS main does not show any modules or transport, although they are installed

Try to re-install the modules and transports. This seems to be caused
by Android accepting permissions only if an App defining this
permission is already installed.

* MAXS does take a long time (~minutes) to react on a command

In order to save energy, Android devices enter a sleep mode after some
idle time. If a device is in this mode, the processing of commands may
be delayed a bit. We could prevent that with MAXS, but the effects on battery
lifetime would likely be catastrophic.
