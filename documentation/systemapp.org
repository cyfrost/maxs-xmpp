Prequisites:
- root access
- =adb= ready to use (i.e., the Android SDK installed)


1. Obtain the =.apk= file of the app you want to make a system app
2. Push the =.apk= file to the device: =adb push my-app.apk /sdcard/=
3. Mount =/system/= read-write

   #+BEGIN_SRC
   adb shell
   su
   mount -o rw,remount /system
   #+END_SRC

4. Place the =.apk= file in the correct directory. This is =/system/app/= for Android 4.2 and lower, and =/system/priv-app/= for Android 4.3 and higher. The further steps will asume we are on Android 4.4 and therefore use =priv-app=

    #+BEGIN_SRC
    adb shell
    su
    cd /sdcard
    mv my-app.apk /system/priv-app
    chmod 644 /system/priv-app/my-app.apk
    #+END_SRC

5. Reboot the device: =adb reboot=
